		<h1>Running mRemoteNG</h1>
		<hr/>

		<h1>Creating a connection</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>Right click on the root item (the little blue globe named &quot;Connections&quot;) in the Connections panel and select &quot;New Connection&quot;.</p>
		<img src="Screenshots/Reference/new_connection.png"/>
		<p>A new item shows up under the root item. You can give it a name now (or rename it later). Here we just name it &quot;Test&quot;.</p>
		<img src="Screenshots/Reference/new_connection_test_item.png"/>
		<p>Now lets look at the Config panel in the bottom left, just under the Connections panel. As you may notice this is where you configure all the properties of connections and folders.</p>
		<img src="Screenshots/Reference/config_panel_01.png"/>
		<p>Fill in the necessary properties and you have just created your first connection!<br/>You can now connect to the server with a simple double-click on the "Test"-connection!</p>
		<div class="isa_info">
			<b>TIP!</b> You can see an indicator in the properties window that is glowing green.<img src="Screenshots/Reference/status_icon.png"/>
			<br/>
			<br/>This icon does a ICMP ping on to check response from the server. If it glows green it indicates a connection response can be made using ping to the host. However this is turned off on windows by default. You have to enable ICMP and allow the firewall access for it.
		</div>
		<h1>Opening and Closing Connections</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>There are multiple ways to open a connection in mRemoteNG, but the easiest way is to double click the connection in the Connections panel.<br/>If you double click the connection you will notice that the connection is going to try and open in a new panel called &nbsp;General&nbsp; and under a tab called &nbsp;Test&nbsp;.</p>
		<img src="Screenshots/Reference/open_connection.png"/>
		<div class="isa_info">
			<b>NOTE! </b>If the connection fails you will find out what the problem was in the dialog notifications panel.
		</div>
		<p>If all goes well you should see the remote desktop without any problems.</p>
		<p>To close the connection you can do any of the following:<ul>
				<li>Log off in the start menu - Closes the connection and logs you out completely from RDP</li>
				<li>Close the panel with the - Which leaves your session active on server but closes connection in mRemoteNG</li>
				<li>Close the connection tab with - Also keeps your login active on server but closes RDP connection in mRemoteNG</li>
				<li>Double click the connection tab - Same as above where the connection is active on server but closes RDP connection in mRemoteNG</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h1>Folders and Inheritance</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>Folders on mRemoteNG cannot only be used to categorize connections but also to inherit properties to underlying connections.</p>
		<div class=lvl1>
			<h2>Example</h2>
			<p>You have 10 Remote Desktop enabled servers in one domain and 15 in another domain.
				<br/>
				Normally you would spend a lot of time creating all those connections and setting the individual properties like username, password, etc. In mRemoteNG there is an easier way. You just create two folders, one for domain A and one for domain B and set all properties there.
				<br/>
				Then create the Connections and let them inherit every property. The only properties left to fill on Connection basis are the Connections name and hostname. Everything else will be inherited from the parent folder.
				<br/><br/>
				Here is how you do this:<br/>
				Add the folder. This can be done like this:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Right click on connections and click on <i>New Folder</i>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>File > New Folder</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						Or with keybinding: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+N</kbd>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<img src="Screenshots/Reference/add_new_folder.png"/>
			<p>Then give it a name and fill all the properties you need (like you did with the test connection)</p>
			<img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_01.png"/>
			<br/>
			<img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_02.png"/>
			<p>When you have filled in the settings and values you can either just drag the test Connection inside the folder or create a new one.</p>
			<img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_03.png"/>
			<p>Right now nothing has changed and nothing will be inherited.<br/>To enable inheritance switch to the inheritance view by clicking the dedicated button. (Marked with a red arrow below)</p>
			<img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_04.png"/>
			<p>The properties that show up now are almost the same as before, but you only select yes or no to enable or disable a inheritance.</p>
			<img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_05.png"/>
			<p>When no is selected the property will not be inherited, yes indicates an inherited property.</p>
			<p>For this test set <i>Inherit Everything</i> to Yes.</p>
			<p>Now if you switch back to the properties view (the button left of the inheritance button) you should see that not much is left of all those properties.</p>
			<img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_06.png"/>
			<p>Only the Name and Hostname/IP properties are left over, everything else will be inherited from the parent folder.</p>
			<p>Of course you can also only let some of the properties be inherited. Just play around with this a bit and you'll get the hang of it.</p>
